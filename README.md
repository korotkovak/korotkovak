## About

iOS developer with 2+ years of commercial experience. I have experience working in a team of up to 6 people. Have utilized SCRUM methodology on projects. Actively participated in daily standups, planning process and retrospectives.

I develop applications on SwiftUI and UIKit, following the SOLID principle. I pay special attention to unit testing. I am constantly learning new technologies, watching WWDC and trying to apply best practices in app development.

Before iOS development I was involved in design, I can help to think through UX or draw UI.
